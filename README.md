# Rock-Paper-Scissors!

A simple implementation of the popular children's game and my favorite way of solving problems.
Done while learning in **The Odin Project!**

### What I learned so far:

* How to use methods like `addEventListener` and `getElementById` to access and change different elements in DOM.
* An easy approach to getting a random choice using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`.
* How to write a nice-looking README.

### What got better: 

* My understanding of how JS works with HTML
